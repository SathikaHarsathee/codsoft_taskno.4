This Python script is designed for spam detection using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
It begins by loading a dataset ('spam.csv') containing SMS messages and preprocessing the data to extract relevant columns and convert labels ('ham' and 'spam') into binary values.
Visualizations are employed to illustrate the distribution of labels in the dataset, highlighting the prevalence of spam messages.
The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, and the TF-IDF vectorization technique is applied to convert text messages into numerical features.
The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is trained on the TF-IDF vectorized training data and evaluated on the test set, with performance metrics such as accuracy, a confusion matrix heatmap, and a classification report. 
Additionally, the script explores the distribution of message lengths by label, shedding light on potential differences between spam and non-spam messages.
Cross-validation scores are calculated to assess the model's generalization performance, and a model tuning section explores different values of the smoothing parameter (alpha) in the Naive Bayes model, providing insights into its impact on accuracy.
Overall, the script provides a thorough approach to spam detection, encompassing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and informative visualizations for a comprehensive understanding of the SMS dataset and the classifier's effectiveness.
